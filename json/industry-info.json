"title":"Health Care Reform ","contents":"The Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) is changing how medical care is acquired and paid for in the US. The landmark law, which makes health coverage available to all Americans, predominantly concerns ways to keep health care costs low and affects how care is paid for. Several provisions of the law kicked in during 2014, including health insurance exchanges and expansion of Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. In an effort to cut Medicare costs, the ACA requires hospitals to decrease their hospital readmission rates, a key factor in high hospital bills. Hospitals that don't succeed in cutting rates are being penalized. Other provisions of the law call for more medical training and the establishment of health care technologies, such as electronic health records (EHRs), that are expected to cut costs through efficiency.

Experts predict a shortages of about 260,000 nurses and 130,000 doctors by 2025. Other analyses, however, say that shortages are regional rather than countrywide, and may be met with incentives for providers to practice in rural and other underserved areas.

To encourage hospitals to improve care quality, Medicare has taken measures such as declaring that it will not reimburse for eight preventable medical errors, such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
